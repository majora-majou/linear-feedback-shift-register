# linear-feedback-shift-register
Using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR), this program will encrpyt and decrypt characters into a string of hexadcecimal value. The characters are converted into bytes and each byte is shifted each iteration and XOR'd if the least significant bit equals 1. Each hexadecimal value is recorded after every 8 steps.
